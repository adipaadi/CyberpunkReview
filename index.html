                    <p>Ever since the announcement of cyberpunk 2077 back in May 2012, it had been on the radar of many gamers who patiently waited for it's launch.

                    <h1 class="font-montserrat hype">Launch</h1>
                    <p>The launch of Cyberpunk 2077 kept getting delayed which infuriated the gamers, but more than gamers the investors were angry and the game was forced to launch in a broken state. The launch was marred by numerous technical issues and bugs. Players reported experiencing game-breaking glitches, crashes, and performance issues on all platforms, including the newest consoles and high-end gaming PCs. CD Projekt Red issued multiple apologies and promises to fix the issues, but the damage to the game's reputation was already done. </p>
